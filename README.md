## Neighborhood Map Project
  This project from Udacity's Front-End Web Dev. Nanodegree program utilizes the
google maps api in order to display information about hikes in Acadia National
Park. A list view on the left hand side provides a filtering option for easy use.

How to run:
  Go to http://ibmalo95.github.io/Neighborhood-Map/.
  To run locally, clone the repository and then open index.html in the browser.

Possible upgrades:
  1. A more accurate image display(Consider using instagram; heard their api has
    better documentation);
  2. Use of a different API that has more information on hiking

Bugs:
  1. A previously open info-window stays on the screen after the filter is
    applied.
  2. Two info windows (Knight Nubble and McFarland Mt.) display other markers info windows.
